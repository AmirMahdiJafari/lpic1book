# Prepare your Lab
Watching videos or even reading books is never enough. You need to have a linux installed and practice your newly accuired knowledge. As you may know, LPIC is a *distro agnostic* test and a LPIC certified guru should be able to work in any GNU/Linux system; or at least on the major ones. Beacuse of this, I suggest you to have two Linux machines which you can work on. One RPM based and one Debian based. 

One very common way, is to use a Virtual Machine. You can install something like [VirtualBOx](https://www.virtualbox.org) (for Win/Linux and Intel Macs) or [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) (for M1 Macs) or any other solution to install your test machines in a Virtual Machine. 

For your distrubition, I suggest [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org) as your Debian based system and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) or [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org)as your RPM based machine. Feel free to install anything else and do whatever you enjoy!

If you want to walk in my steps, do a normal GUI installation. Here is me, installing the Ubuntu 22.04:



And here, you can follow the Fedora 36 installation:




Note: The version is not that important. Here I'm installing Fedora 36 & Ubuntu 22.04.
